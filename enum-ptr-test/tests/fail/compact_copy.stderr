error[E0277]: the trait bound `Foo<'a, 'b>: Copy` is not satisfied

note: required by a bound in `CompactInnerCopy`

  = note: this error originates in the derive macro `EnumPtr` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
help: consider annotating `Foo<'a, 'b>` with `#[derive(Copy)]`

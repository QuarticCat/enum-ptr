error[E0277]: the trait bound `Foo<'a, 'b>: std::marker::Copy` is not satisfied
 --> tests/fail/compact_copy.rs:5:10

  |          ^^^^^^^ the trait `std::marker::Copy` is not implemented for `Foo<'a, 'b>`

note: required by a bound in `CompactCopy`

  = note: this error originates in the derive macro `EnumPtr` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
help: consider annotating `Foo<'a, 'b>` with `#[derive(Copy)]`
